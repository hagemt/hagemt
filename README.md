- 👋 Hi, I’m Tor -- @hagemt
- 👀 I’m interested in doing good for humanity outside of work (and while at work, separately)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go(lang), game dev, as well as some lessons about *life outside tech*
- 💞️ I’m also looking to collaborate on small Python projects, or sites with NextJS (among other things)
- 📫 How to reach me:

```
Confused? Just use: https://linkedin.com/in/hagemt
node -p 'Buffer.from("dGVoIG9uIG5wbWpzLmNvbSBvciBrZXliYXNlLmlv", "base64").toString()'
python3 -c 'from base64 import b64decode; print(b64decode("bWFpbHRvOnRvckBvbmV0b29uZWFuZG9uLnRv"))'
```

I'm not very active on GitHub anymore, so please bear with me (or try another approach) if I appear non-responsive.
