- 👋 Hi, I’m Tor -- @hagemt
- 👀 I’m interested in doing good work, while at work, and life outside of it (separately)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go, game dev, as well as lots of things about life (**outside tech**
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small Python projects, or sites with NextJS (among other things)
- 📫 How to reach me:

```
Confused? https://linkedin.com/in/hagemt
node -p 'Buffer.from("bWFpbHRvOnRvckBvbmV0b29uZWFuZG9uLnRv", "base64").toString()'
python -c 'from base64 import b64decode; print(b64decode("dGVoIG9uIG5wbWpzLmNvbSBvciBrZXliYXNlLmlv"))'
```

I'm not very active on GitHub anymore, so please bear with me, or try something else if I appear non-responsive.
